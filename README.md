In October 2014, I gave a Tools-and-Techniques talk to the Penn Digital Humanities Forum on [Topic Modeling and the Sociology of Literature](http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu/14-15/dhf_goldstone.shtml). Since I made a big song and dance about all the choices involved in each step of the modeling process, I felt I ought to expose the source code for the visualizations I showed as well. This repository holds the files used to build my [slides](http://andrewgoldstone.com/penn2014/slides.pdf). I have removed my notes to myself.

This is probably mostly of interest to anyone curious about how one might develop presentations using an unholy mix of [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), latex-beamer, and GNU make. I have also begun to abuse `%>%` as much as possible in my R. 

Naturally the source will not actually process successfully, absent the data files. This source code is for demonstration, not for unmodified use.

This talk is my own work, drawing extensively on work I have done in collaboration with Ted Underwood for our article [The Quiet Transformations of Literary Studies: What Thirteen Thousand Scholars Could Tell Us](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.7282/T3222RZT), forthcoming in *New Literary History*.
